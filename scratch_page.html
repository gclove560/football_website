    <p></p>The game of football in my opinion is the greatest game to ever be created. It's intense, fast paced, and
    very competitively natured. To explain in the simplest way you have 4 attempts to move the ball 10 yards forward
    before getting tackled. This can be done by means of passing, or running. If you fail to make it the 10 yards you
    can either give up your 4th attempt in order to kick the ball away making it a longer distance for your opponent to
    score or go for it on your 4th attempt and failing gives the ball to the other team where the play ends. If you do
    manage to move the ball forward 10 yards, your 4 attempts starts over attempting to move the ball forward another 10
    yards from wherever the ball was when the last play ended. Scoring is done by either running the ball into the
    endzone or catching the ball inside the endzone. This is called a touchdown, worth 6 points. Following a touchdown
    you kick what's called an extra point, where you kick the football between the uprights of the goal post behind the
    endzone. After the extra point you then kick the ball down the field for the other team to start their attempt at
    offense.
    Below are all the possible scoring methods
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>touchdown</li>
        <li>extra point
        <ul>
            <li>kick</li>
            <li>2 pt conversion</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>safety</li>
    </ol>

    <p id="pinkparagraph"> Over the years there have come to be several football legends to come and play the game. Some on offense, some on defense, some retired, while some are still playing today. Below are some of the biggest names in the NFL at the moment.
